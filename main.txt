Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

Objective: Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.

Option 1: UFW on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Enable UFW and Check Status:
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw status verbose

2. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet):
    sudo ufw deny 23

3. Test the Rule:
    telnet <your-ip> 23  # Should be blocked

4. Allow SSH (Port 22):
    sudo ufw allow 22

5. Remove the Telnet Block Rule:
    sudo ufw delete deny 23

6. View All Rules:
    sudo ufw status numbered

Summary - How Firewalls Filter Traffic (Linux):
- UFW configures iptables rules to control traffic.
- Filters by port, protocol, IP, and direction (in/out).
- Default is deny incoming, allow outgoing.
- Rules are applied top-down.

Option 2: Windows Firewall

1. Open Windows Firewall:
   - Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings

2. View Current Rules:
   - Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules sections

3. Block Port 23 (Telnet):
   - New Rule > Port > TCP 23 > Block the connection > Apply to all profiles > Name it 'Block Telnet'

4. Allow SSH (if installed, port 22):
   - New Rule > Port > TCP 22 > Allow the connection

5. Remove Rule:
   - Locate 'Block Telnet' in Inbound Rules and delete it

Summary - How Firewalls Filter Traffic (Windows):
- Windows Firewall applies rules based on port, app, IP, and direction.
- Profiles include Domain, Private, and Public.
- Stateful inspection allows dynamic traffic control.
